    <p>In my free time, I love basketball, fishing and hunting. I like to be active and am currently training for a marathon with hopes to eventually complete an ironman race.</p>
    <p>My junior year of high school we played in the State Tournament. Here’s a picture of me playing basketball:</p>

    <p>Last August I took a camping trip to Colorado with my brothers, uncles, and cousins.</p>
    <p>We have made it a tradition to go camping every August. We usually go to a different location each year. Last year we went to the boundary waters. It is a good way to relax before summer ends</p>
    <p>Here’s a picture of my brother in a mountain river:</p>
