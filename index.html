        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            I will graduate with my bachelor's this December and have a few more prerequisite classes to take before applying to medical school in the spring.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always knew I wanted to go into the medical field. I tried the Computer Science route at first, but after working an internship, I decided a career in Computer Science is not for me. I do not regret my decision to major in Computer Science, as I have learned many new skills that will help me in my future career.

            This website is all about me. Feel free to explore to learn more about my projects, experience, and interests!
