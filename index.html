        <p>Hello! I’m Samuel Dewey. I’m majoring in Computer Science with a minor in math. My goals after college are to attend medical school. I currently work as a medical scribe in the Emergency Department at Ridges and Southdale Hospital</p>
        <p>I will graduate with my bachelors this December and have a few more prerequisite classes to take before applying to medical school in the spring.</p>
        <p>I think I always knew deep down I wanted to go into the medical field. I tried the Computer Science route at first but after working an internship decided a career in Computer Science is not for me. I do not regret my decision to major in Computer Science however as I have learned many new skills that will help me in my future career no matter what it is.</p>
        <p>This website is all about me.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my website to learn more about me, my projects, and my resume.</p>
