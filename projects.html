          <h4>Test System Upgrade</h4>
          <p>This project was the main project I worked on during my electrical test engineering internship with Entegris last fall.</p>
          <p> The goal of the project was to upgrade an existing test system on one of the companys product lines to improve efficiency, reliability, and security. I was responsible for implementing the upgrade, which included adding new hardware components, updating software, and testing the system to ensure it met all performance requirements.</p>
          <p>THe project involved upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, replacing legacy hardware components with modern equivalents, and implementing new security protocols to protect against cyber threats. I worked closely with a small team of engineers and the floor technicians to ensure that the upgrade was completed on time and within budget.</p>
          <p>Other specifics of the upgrade included transfer of code from VB6 to C#, moving from activeX to .NET frameworks, and integrating with the latest TestStand software.</p>
          <p>Overall, the test system upgrade project was a success, resulting in improved performance, increased reliability, and enhanced security for the test system. The project also provided valuable experience in project management, teamwork, and technical skills related to hardware and software integration.</p>

          <h4>Power BI Healthcare Dashboard</h4>
          <p>This project was completed as part of a data analytics course during the spring semester of 2024.</p>
          <p>The goal was to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualized patient data to provide actionable insights into healthcare metrics, treatment outcomes, and operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>The project involved working with a large dataset of patient records that required significant data cleaning and transformation. I used Power Query to clean and transform the data, then created a robust data model using Power BI's built-in modeling tools.</p>
          <p>Once the data model was complete, I created a series of interactive visualizations displaying key metrics such as patient outcomes, treatment effectiveness, and resource utilization. I implemented advanced features like filters, drill-downs, and dynamic reporting to allow healthcare professionals to explore patient data insights.</p>
          <p>The final dashboard provided a user-friendly interface for healthcare data-driven decision making, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, visualization, and healthcare informatics.</p>
          <p>This project showcases my ability to transform raw patient data into meaningful insights, combining technical skills with analytical thinking to solve real-world healthcare challenges.</p>

          <h4>MineSweeper Game</h4>
          <p>One of the first significant projects I completed as a computer science major at St. Thomas was building a fully functional MineSweeper game using MATLAB.</p>
          <p>The goal was to recreate the classic MineSweeper game with full functionality including game board generation, mine placement logic, user input handling, and win/lose conditions.</p>
          <p>I built this during CISC-130, the introductory programming course at St. Thomas. Taking the course online over J-Term meant intensive daily programming sessions with lectures followed by hands-on coding assignments.</p>
          <p>This project was particularly meaningful as it was my first significant programming accomplishment. It required implementing complex logic for mine detection, recursive cell revealing, and user interface design - all fundamental concepts that shaped my programming foundation.</p>
          <p>The experience taught me problem-solving skills, algorithm design, and the satisfaction of building a complete, functional application from scratch.</p>
